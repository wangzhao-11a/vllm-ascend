# DeepSeek-V4 DSML: make the STREAMING tool_choice == "none" (or omitted, which
# defaults to "none") path consistent with the NON-streaming path.
#
# Background
# ----------
# For ChatCompletions, the non-streaming path (OpenAIServing._parse_tool_calls_
# from_content) does NOT run the tool parser when tool_choice is "none"/omitted,
# so any DSML tool-call markup the model emits stays verbatim in `content`.
# The streaming path, however, drives tool parsing through
# DelegatingParser.parse_delta -> extract_tool_calls_streaming, which runs the
# tool parser regardless of tool_choice and turns the same DSML into
# `delta.tool_calls` (finish_reason="tool_calls"). That is the upstream bug
# vllm-project/vllm#42747 ("streaming invokes tool parser despite
# tool_choice=none"); the two paths disagree.
#
# Fix
# ---
# Wrap DelegatingParser.extract_tool_calls_streaming: when tool_choice is
# "none"/omitted, do NOT invoke the tool parser; surface the delta text (the DSML
# markup) as plain `content` instead. tool_calls stay unset so finish_reason
# falls back to "stop". Result: streaming and non-streaming both return the raw
# DSML in content on the none path -- consistent behavior. The auto / forced
# tool-choice paths are untouched (original parser runs).
#
# (Mirrors upstream PR vllm-project/vllm#42752 done as a vllm-ascend monkey-patch.)
